--- A controller component that stops to wait for input to receive its action.
--- @class GasEmitter : Component
--- @field gas GasTypeName
--- @field direction number angle in radians
--- @field template Vector2[] An array of points in which the actor is 0,0 and 1,0 is direction=0. It will be rotated by direction.
--- @field volume number Amount of gas to release by turn.
--- @field duration integer number of turns to persist for, 0 or <0 is infinite
--- @field period integer release every N turns, i.e. period of 2 is every other turn.
--- @field turns integer number of turns alive
--- @field disabled boolean if true, does nothing. turns do not advance and no emission happens.
